 Python implementation of Spanning Tree Protocol and simulation of Learning Bridges  
- Done as an assignment for CS224M - Computer Networks (by Prof. Varsha Apte) in Autumn 2020 at IIT Bombay  
- Input and Output format in [problem_statement.pdf](problem_statement.pdf) with examples in [test cases](https://github.com/chandak1299/Spanning-Tree-Protocol/tree/master/test%20cases) folder  
- [bridgesim.py](bridgesim.py): Takes input, runs required functions from [bridge.py](bridge.py) and outputs in the desired format  
- [bridge.py](bridge.py): Class and function definitions
- Refer to the book Interconnections by Radia Perlman for algorithm details and worked-out examples
